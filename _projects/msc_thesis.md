    This work dealt with geographical passage retrieval.

    Summary:
    - Geoparsed large dataset (MS-MARCO).
    - Studied state-of-the art approaches for neural passage retrieval (cross-encoders and bi-encoders).
    - Proposed an hard negative sampling technique based on distance between geographic entities within text.
    - Used a pre-trained T5 model for query generation.
    - Proposed a cross-architecture knowledge distillation leveraging fully differentable soft-ranking functions.
